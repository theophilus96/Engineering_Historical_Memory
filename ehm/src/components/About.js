              Dr Andrea Nanetti first theorised Engineering Historical Memory
              (EHM) when he was Visiting Scholar at Princeton University in
              2007. Since then, EHM is an ongoing research project that welcomes
              international and multidisciplinary collaboration to design and
              test interactive applications for virtual (re)organisation and
              delivery of historical knowledge in the digital age. The aim is to
              overcome linguistic obstacles and cultural barriers of historical
              research in a transcultural (re)reading of primary sources and
              secondary literature for the pre-modern history of the
              Afro-Eurasian continent, its people and their interactions between
              1205 and 1533. The stage being the intercontinental communication
              networks by sea and by land as they were first identified by the
              German geographer Ferdinand Freiherr von Richthofen (1833-1905) in
              his magnum opus China (1877-1912). With equally and fairly
              engagement of different cultural environments in Europe, Africa,
              and Asia, this scholarly initiative also aims to contribute to the
              forging of international, intercultural, and interreligious
              dialogue and cooperation.

            Since 2007, EHM is studying and practising "by what means"
            traditional historical scholarship can supply machine-readable
            information sets to empower historical sciences with artificial
            intelligence and machine learning, thus enabling all users to read
            primary historical sources according to different levels of
            knowledge and expertise interactively. In the history domain, EHM
            makes a cross-disciplinary use of established research processes,
            such as mapping as understood in mathematics and linguistics (i.e.,
            an operation that associates each element of a given set, the
            domain, with one or more items of a second set, the range) and
            parsing as understood in computing (i.e., analyse narratives into
            logical syntactic components) to kick-off the exploration of primary
            historical sources. Using these operations of mapping and parsing
            for individual primary historical sources, EHM associates each
            element of given sets of information provided by the domain of the
            traditional disciplines (e.g., history, art history, philology,
            palaeography, diplomatics, codicology, archaeology, epigraphy,
            sigillography) with one or more elements of the range of
            machine-readable content management systems (e.g., spreadsheets,
            computational notebooks). The level of accuracy of this preliminary
            human activity is directly proportional to that of the aggregations
            generated and visualised by the EHM algorithms from different sets
            of similar written or depicted elements in the EHM database (e.g.,
            geographical names, people’s names, goods, ships, governments,
            events, architectures, drawings) and from potentially relevant
            publications, images, videos, and news retrieved in online
            repositories.
          </p>

          <p class="fs-lg text-gray-800 mb-9 mb-md-11">
            To understand and emphasise the unity of EHM as an interactive
            system in the approach to historical information, the rhetorical and
            conceptual linking of “mapping and visualisation” as well as “search
            and visualisation” should be hendiadys. Thus, the term “mapping” is
            understood, in its basic meaning, as the localization and
            description of elements, facts or phenomena that relate to a
            circumscribed area, historically understood at the intersection of
            precise space and time coordinates. The aim is to provide and test
            an example of an innovative epistemological process to visually
            distil historical data. The “visualization” process is seen not as a
            reductive representation to epitomise and/or illustrate written
            narratives, but as an investigative tool that the historian
            (especially one who intends to enter fully into the digital era) can
            use for discovering and organising new relationships between
            objects, in a new historical landscape where past, present, and
            future can merge in a democratised whole (Altman, 2008; Bolick,
            2006).

            The EHM approach to history can be construed as a hybrid
            human-machine methodology because it relies on both human scholarly
            touch and machine computational power. The attributes of the EHM
            methodology (i.e., set of methods) can be named as follows.
